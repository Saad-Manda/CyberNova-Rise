# 🚀 Rocket Booster

**Rocket Booster** is a 3D Unity-based space game where the player controls a rocket and navigates from a launch pad to a landing pad while avoiding obstacles. The game features simple but challenging 2D movement mechanics in a 3D space environment.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Control a rocket and guide it safely through obstacles to reach the landing pad.
- The game features **three unique levels**, each with increasing difficulty.

|--------------|------------------|------------------------|

| Exit Game    | `Escape`         | –                     |

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saad-Manda/Rocket-Booster.git

2. Open the project in Unity 6.

3. Hit **Play** to test in the editor.
   - `File > Build Settings > Build` to generate a playable `.exe`.

## 📦 Builds
You can find the latest `.exe` build of the game in the [**Builds**](./Builds.zip).
To run the game:

- Unzip the folder.
- Open the `.exe` file.

> ⚠️ **Note**: You might see a warning from **Windows Defender SmartScreen** like  
> *"Windows protected your PC"*.  
> This happens because the app is not signed with a verified certificate (common for indie devs).
>
> To run the game anyway:
> - Click **More info**
> - Then click **Run anyway**

### 🐢 Performance Note
You may experience some lag while running the `.exe`:
- The build is not yet fully optimized.
- The game runs with a fixed resolution and no graphic settings.
- Defender sandboxing or lower-end hardware can also affect performance.

> 💡 **Tip**:  
> For the smoothest experience, it's recommended to **open the project in Unity and build it yourself**, especially if you're using a development machine or want better performance.
> 
> This also ensures Unity optimizes the build for your system configuration.

Improvements will be made in future updates.
